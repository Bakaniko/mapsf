Create maps with simple features. `mapsf` helps to map `sf` objects and offers 
features that improve the graphic presentation of maps (scale bar, north arrow, 
title or legend).

## Installation

You can install the released version of mapsf 
from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mapsf")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of mapsf 
from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("riatelab/mapsf")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a map with `mapsf`.
The main `mapsf` function is `mf_map()`. 

```{r example}
library(mapsf)
mtq <- mf_get_mtq()
mf_map(x = mtq)
mf_map(x = mtq, var = "POP", type = "prop")
mf_layout(frame = TRUE)
```

A more detailed example:

```{r example3, results=FALSE}
mf_init(x = mtq, theme = "dark", shadow = TRUE, shadow_col = "grey10",
        export = "svg", filename = "man/figures/mtq.svg", width = 6, 
        expandBB = c(0,0,0,.3)) 
mf_map(x = mtq, var = "MED", type = "choro",
       pal = "Dark Mint", 
       breaks = "quantile", 
       nbreaks = 6, 
       leg_title = "Median Income\n(euros)", 
       leg_val_rnd = -2, 
       add = T)
mf_title("Wealth in Martinique, 2015")
mf_credits("T. Giraud\nSources: INSEE & IGN, 2018")
mf_scale(size = 5)
mf_arrow('topleft')
dev.off()
```
